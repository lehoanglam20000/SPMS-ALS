# SPMS-ALS
This repository includes a Single-Point Memetic Structure for Instance Reduction, a preprocessing phase of classification.  Associated work:  SPMS-ALS: A Single-Point Memetic Structure with Accelerated Local Search for Instance Reduction  Authors: H.L Le, I. Triguero, F. Neri  Submitted to Swarm and Evolutionary Computation.

The experimental execution follows the procedure of KEEL software, more details can be found at: https://www.atlantis-press.com/journals/ijcis/25883592 

Note that due to the evolutionary change of naming the algorithms, the initial names have been amended to other names as follows. This discrepancy can help understand the names used in code and paper.
